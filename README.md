# Automatic shape analysis of particles from electron microscopic images using Python and OpenCV
# Introduction
The electron microscope (EM) is one of the most versatile instruments available for the examination and analysis of the microstructure morphology of particles in different materials. The automatic detection of the different shaped particles and the shape analysis of those particles are vital in EM image analysis. In this blog, we identify the different shaped particles and performed shape analysis using Python and OpenCV.
This repository consists of methods to identify the different shaped particles and performed shape analysis in EM (Electron Microscopic) images using Python and OpenCV.
